(macOS) Prevent binary dependency analysis from spuriously resolving
shared library instance in a standard library path (for example,
Homebrew-installed library in ``/usr/local/lib``) when trying to
resolve ``@rpath``-based reference with multiple candidate run paths
that are anchored to ``@loader_path`` or ``@executable_path`` prefix
that resolves to a completely different path prefix (for example, an
Anaconda python environment).
